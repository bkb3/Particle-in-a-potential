# Particle-in-a-potential
A "classical" problem in quantum mechanics which every student faces. Here we find out the energy values of a particle trapped in a potential. Only the mathematica code part is here which helps us know the problem analytically.


The specfic problem we are dealing with here is

The potential is symmetric under y axis as shown in the graph below obtained by running the mathematica code:

The odd and even parity hermite polynomials are

Finally, the selected eigen functions (1st and 3rd) are plotted as:
